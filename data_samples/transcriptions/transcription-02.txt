Thank you for calling LMN Bank. This is Alex speaking. How can I assist you today?

Hi Alex, I'm calling because I'm having trouble making my credit card payment this month, and I was hoping to discuss some options.

I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulties. I'd be happy to help you explore some solutions. May I have your full name and account number to access your account?

Sure, my name is Lisa Martinez, and my account number is 24681012.

Thank you, Lisa. For security purposes, could you please verify the last four digits of your Social Security Number and your mother's maiden name?

Yes, the last four digits are 1357, and my mother's maiden name is Gonzalez.

Appreciate the verification. Let me pull up your account. I see that your current balance is $1,800, with a minimum payment due of $90 by the 18th of this month. How can I assist you with your payment today?

Well, I've had some unexpected medical expenses, and I won't be able to make the full minimum payment by the due date. I don't want to fall behind or hurt my credit score. Are there any arrangements we can make?

I understand your concern, Lisa. We have a few options that might help. We can offer a short-term payment deferral, enroll you in a payment arrangement, or see if you qualify for a temporary reduction in your interest rate. Would you like me to explain these options?

Yes, please. That would be great.

Certainly. A short-term payment deferral allows you to skip one payment without penalties, moving it to the end of your payment schedule. A payment arrangement lets you split your current minimum payment over a few months to ease your financial burden. Lastly, a temporary interest rate reduction can lower your monthly payments for a certain period. Which of these options sounds most helpful to you?

I think splitting the payments over a few months would work best for me.

Understood. With a payment arrangement, we can divide your $90 minimum payment into three installments of $30 over the next three months. This way, you'll stay current on your account without incurring late fees. Would you like to proceed with this arrangement?

Yes, that sounds manageable.

Great. I'll set up the payment arrangement for you. Your new payment schedule will be $30 due on the 18th of each month for the next three months. Please ensure that each payment is made on time to avoid any penalties. Is this acceptable?

Yes, that's perfect. Thank you for your help.

You're welcome, Lisa. I've updated your account with the new payment schedule. You'll receive a confirmation email with all the details shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Actually, could you tell me if this arrangement will affect my credit score?

That's a great question. As long as you make the agreed-upon payments on time, your account will remain in good standing, and there should be no negative impact on your credit score. It's important to adhere to the new payment schedule we've set up.

Okay, that's a relief. Thanks for clarifying.

Happy to help. If there's nothing else, I want to thank you for calling LMN Bank. We're here to support you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.

Will do. Thanks again, Alex.

You're welcome, Lisa. Take care, and have a great day!

You too. Goodbye.
