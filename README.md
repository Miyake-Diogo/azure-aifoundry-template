Azure AI Foundry Template to create Resources using Bicep

## Introduction
This template provides a streamlined approach to deploying Azure resources with Bicep. It is designed to simplify infrastructure as code practices and serve as a starting point to deploy secure and scalable resources on Azure.

## Prerequisites
- **Azure CLI:** Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to interact with your Azure resources.
- **Bicep CLI:** Ensure the [Bicep CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install) is installed to compile and deploy your Bicep templates.
- **Azure Subscription:** You must have an active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have sufficient permissions to deploy resources within your subscription.
- **Visual Studio Code (Optional):** For an enhanced development experience, it is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the Bicep extension.

# Disclaimer
